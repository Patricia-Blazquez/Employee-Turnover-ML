## **Project Description**
This project analyzes employee turnover rates within a company and implements a **Machine Learning** system to identify employees at risk of leaving. The goal is to understand key patterns and provide data-driven insights to reduce turnover and its associated costs.

## **1. Main Problem**
Employee turnover can have a significant impact on business performance, affecting operational efficiency and increasing recruitment costs. Currently, there are no clear metrics on:
- Turnover rates.
- The financial impact of employee departures.
- The profiles of employees most likely to leave.

This project aims to:
- Understand the key factors driving turnover.
- Provide actionable insights for HR and management teams.
- Develop a predictive model to anticipate employees at risk of leaving.
- Implement data-driven strategies to reduce turnover and retain talent.

## **2. Approach**
To tackle this issue, we will follow a structured methodology:

### üîç **Business Analytics**
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends.
- Generate insights to quantify the problem from a business perspective.
- Identify the most relevant features influencing employee turnover.

### ü§ñ **Machine Learning**
- Develop a predictive model to identify employees at high risk of leaving.
- Evaluate different algorithms and select the best-performing one.
- Interpret model results to provide actionable recommendations.

### üìä **Deployment & Visualization**
- Build a **Tableau Dashboard** to communicate findings effectively.
- Provide data-driven recommendations for management to implement retention strategies.
